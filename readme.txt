Issuu Publication Downloader v1.0 (2012-03-18)

About Issuu:
Issuu is an online service that allows for realistic and customizable viewing
of digitally uploaded material, such as portfolios, books, magazine issues,
newspapers, and other print media. It integrates with social networking sites
to promote uploaded material. Issuu's service is comparable to what Flickr
does for photo-sharing, and what YouTube does for video-sharing. While most
of the documents are meant to be viewed online, some can be downloaded and
saved as well. Uploaded print material is viewed through a web browser and is
made to look like a printed publication with an animated page flip options.

About This Tool:
The tool itself is a batch script that uses GNU Wget made by Giuseppe Scrivano
and Hrvoje Nikšiæ. The main purpose of it is downloading Issuu publications
which aren't available for the download the usual way. Normally, to download an
Issuu publication, one has to register first, and publication itself needs to
have download enabled. When using this tool neither of these two requirements
are needed because it downloads the images, shown to users through a Flash
application when they are reading them, directly from the server.

How to Use It:
You can either run it with Windows Explorer or call it through Command Prompt.
Just run a file named issuudl.bat and you will be asked to enter a document ID
and number of pages of the publication you want to download. All downloaded
files are being saved into downloads folder, into a subfolder named by document
ID. You can also call it with Command Prompt and use it with parameters. First
parameter is Document ID and second one is Number of Pages. Not specifying one
or both of those parameters will result in batch file asking you to input them.
You can also specify a third parameter which is a name of the folder in which
downloaded files will be saved. Keep in mind that a long name argument needs
to be enclosed with quotes. This parameter is optional and if you don't specify
it folder will be named by document ID. Upon downloading the publication
"Done!" message will be displayed accompanied by a beep sound.

Final Words:
I made this tool because I couldn't find another way to download ebook named
The Art of Video Games: From Pac-Man to Mass Effect. In the end, I decided to
share it hoping it might help someone, somewhere out there. Feel free to visit
